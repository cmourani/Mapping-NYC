Heavily seasoned with star anise, the accompanying broth (sold separately, by customer demand) is as good as that of any pho in the city, and completes the soup-to-sandwich concept for a French dip-meets-pho moment.

Hamburger America slices the meat thin and warms it on a flattop under a sheet of Swiss cheese. This goes on a hamburger bun rather than a roll baked that morning, which is too bad, but the bun is buttered and crisped to order in the vertical toaster that stands behind the counter.
