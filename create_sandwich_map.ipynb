Now, the dish formerly known as the Char Siu McRib is the char siu BK Rib, but it remains the top seller, and for good reason. It takes three days to marinate and steam the ribs, which are deboned and paired with a sesame milk bun, a smear of Chinese hot mustard, sliced onion and bread-and-butter pickles. The pork melts into the bun, and the pickles and spicy mustard bring tangy, sharp relief. PRIYA KRISHNA\n"

Now, the dish formerly known as the Char Siu McRib is the char siu BK Rib, but it remains the top seller, and for good reason. It takes three days to marinate and steam the ribs, which are deboned and paired with a sesame milk bun, a smear of Chinese hot mustard, sliced onion and bread-and-butter pickles. The pork melts into the bun, and the pickles and spicy mustard bring tangy, sharp relief. PRIYA KRISHNA\n",

Not so at the popular Radio Bakery in Greenpoint, where the pastry chef Kelly Mencin serves smoked salmon with a schmear of whipped cream cheese seasoned with pickled red onions and dill, all sandwiched between airy, crispy, everything-seasoned focaccia The bread recipe was perfected by Rafiq Salim, a partner here and a Gramercy Tavern vet, but the idea to serve it in this inventive, satisfying form is all Ms. Mencin’s. On weekends, the sandwich tends to sell out well before 11 a.m., but hopefully that won’t be an issue when a second Radio Bakery opens in Prospect Heights later this year. NIKITA RICHARDSON",

Their most popular sandwich is the bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel, the platonic ideal of hangover food, with an added latke layer. It may not be kosher, but it’s texturally thrilling — the bagel chewy, eggs impossibly fluffy, the latke doing that crunchy-outside, creamy-inside thing that will cure what ails you. BECKY HUGHES",

But at Shelsky’s, these two stalwarts shine magnificently in the Newhouse sandwich. Made from toasted, housemade bialys and translucent slivers of wild Alaskan smoked sable, the sandwich is rounded out with scallion cream cheese for plushness, and sliced tomato for a touch of juicy sweetness. It’s an if-you-know-you-know combination that aficionados of appetizing might build for themselves from a bat mitzvah brunch platter, but it’s rarely seen preconstructed in the wild. For smoked fish lovers, this is a real opportunity to kvell. MELISSA CLARK",

Their most popular sandwich is the bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel, the platonic ideal of hangover food, with an added latke layer.

Made from toasted, housemade bialys and translucent slivers of wild Alaskan smoked sable, the sandwich is rounded out with scallion cream cheese for plushness, and sliced tomato for a touch of juicy sweetness.

He later renamed the store Faicco’s Italian Specialties, and decided to introduce the mammoth sandwiches the shop is now known for. The shop’s most popular offering, the Italian hero, starts with crusty Italian bread from Mona Lisa Bakery in Dyker Heights, and is stuffed to the brim with freshly sliced prosciutto from Italy, Italian cappy-style ham from Boar’s Head, sweet soppressata, and mozzarella cheese that’s made at the shop.

You can always get a chicken cutlet sandwich at Royal Crown, but the sandwich is nearer to perfection at the bakery’s offshoot cafe on the south shore, where oozy mozzarella and a tangy-sweet balsamic vinegar glaze soak into a crisp chicken cutlet swaddled in freshly baked bread.

Ms. Collerton and her partners, Caroline Fidanza and Elizabeth Shula, couldn’t change it: “People would get very, very mad, send us angry emails and would cry,” Ms. Fidanza said. It remained a best seller until Saltie closed in 2017, a year before Ms. Collerton died from cancer.

One afternoon in 2015, the chef Ned Baldwin, inspired by gooey cheese-topped French onion soup, slid some caramelized onions he had on hand for a burger in between slices of brioche and funky raclette cheese. He griddled it and served it for staff meal, where it was such a hit that he moved it to the lunch menu — with a few canny tweaks. Now the sandwich is seasoned with grainy mustard for tang and maple syrup for sweetness, and the brioche is coated in Parmesan, then crisped, frico-like, in the hot pan.

       "  'description': 'What makes a tuna or chicken salad sandwich so good? The combination of ingredients, sure, but also the perfect distribution of ingredients, made possible only by chopping everything to bits. Farmer in the Deli asks the question: What if that same ethos was applied to any sandwich? Turkey, bacon, lettuce, provolone, salt, vinegar and tomatoes? Chopped. No longer a sandwich as you might have imagined it, but the sandwich you didn’t know you were waiting for. NIKITA RICHARDSON',\n",

To be sure, it’s got a prosciutto of provenance, made from whey-fed Parma pigs and cured for 36 months before being shipped across the Atlantic. But just as important is the exquisite Rodolphe Le Meunier butter (affectionately nicknamed R.L.M. on the Larder’s menu), which is handmade in France in wooden churns and seasoned with fleur de sel. Then there’s the Runner & Stone sourdough baguette — thinner, chewier and crisper than many of its ilk. Still, the magic comes together in the sandwich’s construction: Equal parts creamy butter and salty ham are slathered on the bread and layered into a filling almost as thick as the baguette slices themselves. It’s substantial but not at all overwhelming, a lovingly made Brooklyn take on an elegant classic. MELISSA CLARK',\n",

Hamburger America slices the meat thin and warms it on a flattop under a sheet of Swiss cheese.

The sandwich is inspired by a fried tamago that the chef Evan Hanczor first encountered in Tokyo — where he owns another restaurant. The eggs are cooked in a water bath at a low temperature, giving them their custardy texture, then sliced into planks and fried in a mixture of flour and panko. The end result is impossibly fluffy and tender yet crispy, and tastes even more luxurious in a brioche bun, embellished with a punchy yuzu kosho, pickled shallot mayo and arugula. PRIYA KRISHNA',\n",

Alidoro understands that prosciutto needs to be sliced and folded with care so when you bite down it doesn’t come zooming out of the bread in a big, stringy pink wad. On our more Spartan days, we gravitate toward the Galileo, which augments the ham with fresh mozzarella and nothing else. When we’re seeking thrills, we like the Alidoro, which buries the prosciutto under sweet peppers, hot peppers, arugula leaves and curls of shaved fennel, all inside bread slathered with mushroom paste and spicy-chile spread. But when life hasn’t pushed us to either extreme, we heed the call of the Michelangelo: provolone and hot peppers with arugula over layers of that meticulously arranged prosciutto. PETE WELLS',\n",

It starts with slightly risen bread that is cooked on a griddle and flipped like a pancake, resulting in a crispy brown exterior and a fluffy center that hugs the chunks of spicy cumin lamb. The cumin lamb, a signature item at the restaurant and a staple in Xinjiang, in northwest China, is a family recipe and one of the few dishes that Jason Wang, the owner, enjoyed as a child.

This produces a rugged and remarkably sturdy shell that maintains its crunch even as it laps up Rowdy Rooster’s fire-breathing chile butter. Pickled onions and mint chutney are brought to bear, too. Yogurt blended with scallions does the job often performed by mayonnaise, and does it in a more interesting way. PETE WELLS',\n",
